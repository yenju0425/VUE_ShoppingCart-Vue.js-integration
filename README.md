# Vue Shopping Cart App (Part I: Vue.js as a plugin)

Welcome to the Vue Shopping Cart App - an excellent exercise to learn about the famous front-end framework Vue.js. This project is a practice from a YouTube tutorial, and I have added my own comments and completed all the tasks left off by the original author.

By working through this project, you will gain a solid understanding of:

- What Vue.js is capable of and its benefits.
- How to use Vue.js directly in an HTML page by creating a Vue instance that controls elements and manages data flow between components.
- Basic but essential directives in Vue.js, such as v-for, v-if, v-on, v-bind, and v-model.
